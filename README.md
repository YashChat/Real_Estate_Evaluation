# Real_Estate_Evaluation
This project is a part of AAI 500 Probability and Statistics for Artificial Intelligence. In this project, we will work with a dataset of real estate transactions in Taiwan to predict the house price of a unit area based on several features.

Introduction:
This project aims to predict the price per unit area of real estate in Taiwan based on various factors such as transaction date, house age, distance to nearest MRT station, number of convenience stores, latitude and longitude. The dataset used in this project is publicly available on Kaggle.

Project Structure:
The project structure is as follows:

data: This folder contains the dataset used in the project - Real estate valuation data set.xlsx
report: Final-Project-Report-Yash-Chaturvedi(2).pdf

README.md: This file.

Requirements:
The project requires the following libraries to be installed:

numpy
pandas
seaborn
matplotlib
scikit-learn
statsmodels
To install these libraries, use the following command:
pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn statsmodels

Usage:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/<username>/real-estate-price-prediction.git
Navigate to the repository: cd real-estate-price-prediction
Install the required libraries as mentioned above.
Open the Jupyter notebook in the notebooks folder.
Run the notebook step by step to reproduce the analysis.
The notebook generates a model to predict the price per unit area based on the given features.
The model can be used to predict the price of real estate by providing the features as input.
